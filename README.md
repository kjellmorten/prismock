# prismock (forked version)

> [!NOTE]
> This is a fork of the excellent [prismock](https://github.com/morintd/prismock)
> package. The fork adds support for `nanoid()` as default id type, and a crude
> and limited implementation of extending with the `$extends` method. It's not
> intended for public use, and we encourage you to use the original package
> instead.
